# Score Keeper Discord Bot
Discord bot to create &amp; update leaderboards.

For now, it is really basic, because I don't consider it to get popular.

## Commands
`.lb` creates brand new leaderboard message.  
`.add [@runner] [time in M:S:MS format]` adds a new runner to the leaderboard.  
`.remove [@runner]` removes a runner from the leaderboard.  
`.clear [amount]` deletes multiple messages above the request & the request itself.  
...and... That's all for now.

# If you want to contribute
You can run code (or the .bat file) once for the program to create all the missing private files. It will ask you to enter a token for your bot. Just get one from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and you can use this code with your bot however you want.

I am not very active on GitHub but I will be glad if you have some ideas to share.
